# GWoT-VST-Docs

Project-Documentation written with MkDocs

***

### Build-process

* You need Python (2.7.2) and the Python Package Index (1.5.2) to build the documentation. Check if your operating-system provides it already:

```
python --version
pip --version
```

* This documentation uses [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/), so that the documentation can be written in Markdown. **Cheat cheets** for Markdown can be found here:
	* [https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
	* [https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)

* Install MkDocs with the following command:

```
pip install mkdocs
```

* Clone this repository to a local-repository and build the documentation with the following command:

```
mkdocs build
```

**Attention**: If some problems occur during the build-process, you can also try to re-build the documentation with the following command:
```
mkdocs build --clean
```

* If you want to add new pages to this documenation, create a new `.md`-Files in folder: `docs/`
**Hint**: If you want to add sections, create a new folder, like this: `docs/NewSection` and create your new `.md`-files in this folder

* Before building, don't forget to add your new page(s) and sections in the `mkdocs.yml`-file. Please find an example at the end of this page: `NewSection` and `newSinglePage.md`

```

* Build the documentation with the command above (see: 4.). All `.md`-files will be generated into `.html`-files in the folder `site/`.

mkdocs serve
```
